# Machine-Learning-Neural-Networks-III
All of my R code from the Machine Learning &amp; Neural Networks III module at Durham University, including work done in computer practical classes and examinations, taken as a 3rd year student in 2023/2024. Topics include different types of regression, decision trees, different variations of gradient descent, support vector machines, and neural networks.
